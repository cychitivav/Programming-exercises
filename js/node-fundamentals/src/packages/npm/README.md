# Node Package Manager (NPM)

## Init

When you want to create a new package, you can use the following command to initialize the package.

```bash
npm init
```

This will create a `package.json` file in the current directory with the information you provided.

## Install

To install a package, you can use the following command.

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

This will install the package in the `node_modules` directory and add it to the `package.json` file.
