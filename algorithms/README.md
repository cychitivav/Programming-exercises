# Data structures & algorithms in python 
This is the notebook for the algorithms and data structures in python course offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513). The course is divided into 6 parts:

* Efficiency
* List-based collections
* Searching and sorting
* Maps and hashing
* Trees
* Graphs

## Efficiency
It's also called complexity and it's used to measure how you are using your computer's resources. It's important to know how to measure the efficiency of your code because it's a way to compare different solutions to the same problem. The measure of efficiency is usually expressed in terms of time and space.
